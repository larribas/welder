**Welder** knows his way around pipes. You give him some pipes and he will weld them together and make sure they work. No sweat.


## Present and Future

Welder is still at welding school. The next steps in his career will be:
* Learning about pipes and how to connect them together
* Testing and refining her skills
* Getting a nice toolbelt to start her work (extra gems with useful pipes our of the box)
* Creating a professional profile (gem and docs) so that people can hire her
